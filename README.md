# 1. How do you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable? Especially consider your work on the CRUD Python module from Project One, which you used to connect the dashboard widgets to the database in Project Two. What were the advantages of working in this way? How else could you use this CRUD Python module in the future?
I ensure that the programs I write embody the qualities asked by considering every possible use case or error. If I foresee the potential future applications for a program, I strive to make it understandable and adaptable. For instance, the Python CRUD module design allowed for seamless integration with other modules we employed later on. This means I can easily utilize the module to interface with other MongoDB examples I may employ down the line with few changes needed.
# 2. How do you approach a problem as a computer scientist? Consider how you approached the database or dashboard requirements that Grazioso Salvare requested. How did your approach to this project differ from previous assignments in other courses? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to create databases to meet other client requests?
As a computer scientist, I tackle problems with an analytical and disciplined mindset. While working on the Grazioso Salvare project, I made an intensive effort to grasp the projectâ€™s requirements thoroughly, thoroughly outlining the needs and the steps required for implementation of their needs. This approach is compared to my prior methods in other courses, where I may not have been as detailed. In upcoming endeavors, I aim to continue honing this level of precision and detail-oriented approach.
# 3. What do computer scientists do, and why does it matter? How would your work on this type of project help a company, like Grazioso Salvare, to do its work better?
Computer scientists play an important role in constructing and refining computer-driven solutions to enhance and streamline processes, ultimately improving efficiency within their endeavors. The significance lies in the ability of computer scientists to drive productivity further, utilizing computational skills to employ data in various ways. Through my involvement in this project, I contribute to enabling companies to excel by providing them with comprehensive insights into their business processes and optimizing workflow to drive productivity, subsequently increasing their profitability.
